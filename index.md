## Lab Vision 

The vision of our lab is to realize robust autonomous systems built for real-world perception and interactive decision-making.
The key focus areas of our lab are perception, decision-making and interaction.
Our focus is broad because we believe that innovating at the system-level requires expertise and integration at the component level.

We innovate across the full spectrum of perception including vision-based human pose estimation, action recognition, object detection/tracking/forecasting, 3D scene understanding.
We develop computational models for reinforcement learning, inverse reinforcement learning, imitation learning, game-theoretic modeling and Neural Architecture Search.
We build real-world systems to enable cyber-physical interaction including wearable camera systems, multi-modal sensors, portable navigational aides and assistive mobile robots.
